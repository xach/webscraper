"webscraper" is a half-baked project for pulling stuff out of HTML
documents with closure-html and cxml-stp. It has a few higher-order
functions for creating useful predicates for matching nodes in the
document.

It is available under an MIT-style license. See the file LICENSE.txt
for details.

It's half-baked so I don't expect anyone to use it, ever, but if you
have questions about it, you can email me, Zach Beane <xach@xach.com>.
